localStorage ----------
localStorage is used to store data with no expiration date.
 This means the data will persist even when the browser is closed and reopened. 
 It is useful for storing data that you want to be available across browser sessions.

Key Points:

Persistent storage: Data remains even after closing the browser.
Storage limit: Typically around 5-10 MB depending on the browser.
Synchronous API: Operations are completed immediately.


sessionStorage ----------
sessionStorage is used to store data for a single session. 
The data is deleted when the browser tab is closed. 
It is useful for storing temporary data that should not persist between sessions.

Key Points:

Session-based storage: Data is deleted when the browser tab is closed.
Storage limit: Typically around 5 MB depending on the browser.
Synchronous API: Operations are completed immediately.
